          Anna is a New York based folk/contemporary christian artist whose
          music has been inspired by Bon Iver, Priscilla Ahn and Brooke Fraser,
          to name a few. She started singing when she was just 8 years old and
          learned how to play the piano and guitar as well. Her YouTube channel
          was first created in 2008 as a platform to share her music with
          others. She has written original songs as well as covered songs from
          other artists.
          <br /><br />Over the years, she has been able to grow her passion for
          music at Church. One of her favorite bible verse is from Psalm 13:6,
          <br /><br />
          <blockquote>"I will sing to the Lord, for he has been good to me."</blockquote>
